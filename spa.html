                            good health, suppleness and strength. Today, the role of massage therapy is recognized by the general public and 
                            other health care professionals as being an effective health care alternative. Due to public perception and desire, 
                            massage therapy has grown into a more prominent position. It is a viable and respected profession promoting good 
                            health not only for your physical but emotional well being also. Massage Therapy is the kneading, manipulation or 
                            application of methodical pressure and friction of the body. Whether it is for treatment of injury, stress or for relaxation, 
                            the skilled use of massage through touch is used to maintain and enhance the health and well being of the entire body.
